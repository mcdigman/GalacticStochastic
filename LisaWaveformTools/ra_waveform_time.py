    This function perturbs the intrinsic amplitude, phase, and frequency of a time domain intrinsic_waveform
    from the stationary wave approximation to compute the TDI intrinsic_waveform in the stationary wave approximation.
    Uses the real (RR) and imaginary (II) components already computed and stored in sc_channels
    using the rigid adiabatic approximation.
    Results are stored in-place in the tdi_waveform parameter. The function handles the general case
    and a subset of special cases where the real (RR) and imaginary (II) components are zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spacecraft_channels : SpacecraftChannels
        Object containing the real (RR) and imaginary (II) components of the spacecraft
        response, along with their derivatives (dRR, dII)
    AET_waveform : StationaryWaveformTime
        Target intrinsic_waveform object where the modified TDI amplitude and phase will be stored.

    waveform : StationaryWaveformTime
        Input intrinsic_waveform object containing the original phase (PT) and amplitude (AT) data
    lc : LISAConstants
        LISA constellation constants containing the strain frequency (fstr)

    Notes
    -----
    - The function assumes positive frequencies
    - When RR and II are both near zero, there can be a step function in the phase
      corresponding to a Dirac delta function in frequency, which is not currently
      represented in the frequency or derivative
    - The phase perturbation is computed using arctan2 and is kept within [0, 2Ï€]
    - The frequency derivative calculation ignores potential delta functions that
      can occur from step functions in the phase when RR or II pass through zero
    - All input arrays must be properly sized:
      - sc_channels.RR shape: (nc_channel, n_t)
      - intrinsic_waveform.PT shape: (n_t,)
