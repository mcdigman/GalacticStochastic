# GalacticStochastic
GalacticStochastic is a Python package for simulating realizations of the galactic stochastic background as seen by
the LISA gravitational wave observatory.
It is an improvement of the code described in
[ LISA Gravitational Wave Sources in A Time-Varying Galactic Stochastic Background ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14813)
to enable easier re-running the code with different realizations of the galaxy,
or different instrumental noise models, or modifying the iterative fitting procedure.
