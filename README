GalacticStochastic is a python module which implements the iterative fitting procedure
described in arXiv:2206.14813 to approximate the LISA foreground from unresolved galactic binaries.
The code takes a Galaxy specified as an hdf5 file, input parameters specified in a a .toml configuration file,
and outputs the results as a compressed hdf5 file. The state of the fit can be reloaded into memory from
the output hdf5 file, unless certain options are chosen to reduce the memory size of the output file.

The code is structured to allow for reproducibility of results, easy modification of the input Galaxy,
and the individual component objects have modular interfaces to allow for easy modification of the fitting procedure.

Because there are typically a large number of binaries which individually have no chance of being detected
but which all need to be added to the coadded galactic signal, the first iteration of the procedure is typically
the most expensive iteration by far. Therefore, the code handles the first iteration differently.
The first iteration is considered the 'preliminary' iteration, and allows the results
from the first loop to be saved to an hdf5 file and reloaded separately from the rest of the fitting procedure.
It should only exclude binaries that are virtually guaranteed to be undetectable. To accomplish this, it considers only
instrument noise, and can use a different SNR cutoff and observation time window from later iterations.
For example, if it were run with a lower cutoff snr of 5 and an observing time of 10 years, while later iterations
are expected to use a cutoff snr of 7 and an observing time of 4 years, then there would be virtually zero chance
of a binary being suppressed incorrectly by the preliminary iteration.
Using a conservative cutoff allows the preliminary iteration to be run once and saved to disk.
If the initially chosen cutoff is *too* conservative, a second preliminary iteration can be run with a less
conservative cutoff, using the results of the first preliminary iteration to speed up the second preliminary iteration.

Once a satisfactory preliminary iteration has been run and saved to disk, the main iterative fitting procedure
can be run multiple times with different fitting parameters or time windows.

The code is primarily run through the function
`fetch_or_run_iterative_loop`, imported from `GalacticStochastic.iterative_loop`.
The behavior of the function is controlled by the `fetch_mode` and `preprocess_mode` parameters,
as documented in the function's docstring.

To run the full procedure on a specified Galaxy and configuration file with a basic set of default arguments,
first install from the top directory using

`pip install .`

then the procedure can be run from the command line utility:

run-galactic-stochastic-iterative galaxy_dir config_file

Where galaxy_dir is a directory that contains the galaxy file, and config_file is the filename of a .toml file that contains
the various configuration parameters.

The names of the input and output hdf5 files can be set in the .toml file. By default, they are

```
[files]
# values related to file io

galaxy_file = 'galaxy_binaries.hdf5'

# prefix for final processed filename
processed_prefix = 'processed_iterations'
preprocessed_prefix = 'preprocessed_background'
```

The `preprocessed_prefix` argument is a filename containing the dump of the fit state after the first iteration, and
`processed_prefix` contains the results of the remaining iterations. The level of detail contained in the output hdf5 files can be controlled
by arguments provided by the .toml files. Typically in the limit of >~100 million binaries, the preprocessed file will approach ~half the file size
of the intput galaxy_file, while the final processed files will be smaller, though the exact sizes will depend on the sampling rate and assumed
length of LISA operations.

I suggest copying and modifying a unique configuration file for each galaxy into the directory
that the galaxy will be written to, to ensure the exact run can be replicated in the future.

Care should be taken to use differen directories for each galaxy, or else multiple galaxies may overwrite each other.
